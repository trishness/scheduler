# scheduler

This assignment implements the use of JQuery and moment.js. It entailed creating a daily scheduler interactively through these methods. It required the current date and time to be sourced from moment.js, then the comparison of the scheduler to the current time. Depending on how the time slot compares to the current time, the schedule will appear a certain color - grey for hours past, red for the current hour, and green for upcoming hours. It then required buttons to be connected to each time slot that would save that individual time slot's text content to local storage when clicked. This incorporated the use of "click" functions and referencing "this" element to assign buttons to the proper text areas. Once that button is clicked, the text content should be saved and remain in the scheduler's time slot when the page is refreshed. The current date is constantly displayed at the top of the page above the scheduler itself for user reference.
